**NOTE:** The v0.4.1 is the current release. For more information, please see the [Roadmap](https://github.com/di2e/Argo/wiki/Argo-Roadmap).

## **What is Runtime Service Discovery?**

The Argo Runtime Service Discovery is a simple and robust protocol for the discovery and location of services on a wide-area network without the use of a central or federated registry.  The primary use-case is to communicate configuration information – such as IP Address and Port – to service consumers.  This service discovery protocol has been released as an open source project called Argo.  The technology and architecture behind Argo is not novel and has been in common use for decades (such as Bonjour and WS-Discovery).

Argo is extremely easy to use.  To have your services participate in the discovery ecosystem, simply install the Argo Responder according to the instructions and start the Responder.  This takes about 5-6 minutes.  There are no changes required to any code to advertise services.

## What does Argo do?

To see what Argo does and why it does it, please read the [Argo Primary Use-cases](https://github.com/di2e/Argo/wiki/Argo-Primary-Use-cases).

## Up and Running in 5 Minutes

Argo is actually not hard to setup.  If you want to get Argo up and running quickly, you can follow [these instructions](https://github.com/di2e/Argo/wiki/Up-and-running-in-5-minutes) and have services advertised in just a few minutes.

## Why Argo?

There are many service location/discovery protocols to choose from.  If you are wondering "Why Argo?", then you should read [Why Argo and not some other SLP?](https://github.com/di2e/Argo/wiki/Why-Argo-and-not-some-other-SLP%3F)

## Participate in the Argo Community

***Argo Google Group***:

## Argo Architecture and Protocol

The Argo architecture and Protocol is pretty simple and flexible.  To take a look the details, you should read [Argo Architecture and Protocol](https://github.com/di2e/Argo/wiki/Architecture-and-Protocol)

## Creating an Argo Client Application

The real power of service discovery happens with you have it built into your application/system.  Doing this with Argo is pretty easy.  Directions on how to do this are included in [Creating an Argo Client](https://github.com/di2e/Argo/wiki/Creating-an-Argo-Client) page.
